# Daily AI/ML Projects

This repository contains a collection of daily AI and Machine Learning projects, each focusing on real-world applications in various industries. The goal is to complete one project each day, implementing and learning from each to gain practical experience in AI/ML. Topics covered include recommendation systems, NLP chatbots, computer vision, predictive maintenance, fraud detection, and more.

## Project Overview

Each project folder contains code, data, and relevant documentation for implementing a specific AI or ML solution. Below is a list of all projects, organized by day, with links to detailed descriptions and instructions for each.
